# Leaf (LDAP Extra Attribute Filters)

> *LDAP is protocol for data communication, with rich semantics for data
> modelling, security and database administration.  The security is
> security-in-the-large, though, to protect the communications and
> the integrity of the database itself.  Security in-the-small, for
> instance dealing with the privacy of individual attributes, is not
> a concern for most LDAP servers.  Leaf adds LDAP middleware; a
> man-in-the-middle LDAP proxy server that can filter queries and
> responses to ensure the privacy or confidentiality of the attributes
> passing through the middleware.
